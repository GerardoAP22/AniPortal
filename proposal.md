# Project-2-Proposal

## AniPortal

## Project Description 

My app is called AniPortal. It's a site that lists a bunch of anime. Users who log in are able to add, edit and delete thier reviews. They will also be able to give the anime a review out of 10. On the anime's detail screen, it will contain thier name, studio that created the show, when it was aired, reviews and its average review score. Users will also be able to add the show to thier watch list that keeps track of all of thier shows.
