# AniPortal

## Project Description 

My app is called AniPortal. It's a site that currently lists 50 anime shows. Users who are logged in are able to add, edit and delete thier reviews. These reviews contains a text area and a rating out of 10. There will be a page that llists the 50 animes and a details button which shows the anime's title, synopsis, airing season, airing year, if it is currently showing and its reviews that users left on it. Users will also be able to add the show to thier list that keeps track of all the shows they are either watching or interested in. The user will also be able to delete these shows off their list by clicking the delete button.

## Getting Started
- [Heroku](https://aniportal-117465ef4fc0.herokuapp.com/)

## Future Steps
- I would like to add search functionality that will allow users to easily find the show they are looking for.
- Using the search functionality, I can dynamically search through the api's information instead of just seeding 50 shows to start.
